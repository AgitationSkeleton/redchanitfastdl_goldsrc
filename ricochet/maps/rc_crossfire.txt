RC_Crossfire

I thought this map would be an awesome ricochet map.  Hell its just an awesome map.  There are some texture glitches,  You wouldn't believe how bad winbsp screwed up the textures.  There is an Easteregg. If you find it without decompiling, or noclip I will be amazed. I think I hid it pretty good.  I would appriciate some feedback bad or good, just make sure if its bad you tell me why and not just flame me on how I copied valves map because it IS valves map, I just hacked it. 

Known bugs : 
None except for texture glitches, i was too lazy to fix everything.

Thanks too Lethal_injection, leaver@dleaver.freeserve.co.uk, for the Laser turret prefab. I was too lazy to figure out how to make one myself.  

Also thanks to all the testers : Sinbon, Hylander, Zombie_Lord, Windfart, Mew, Newbie,and Scorpian_Sting
 and to anyone I've forgotten.

Installation:
Just put rc_crossfire.bsp into your half-life/ricochet/maps directory
