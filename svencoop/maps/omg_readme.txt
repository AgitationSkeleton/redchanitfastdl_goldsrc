Description		: messing about map


I created this map sometime in early 2003, simply as a mess-around map for the great svencoop server, SHELL!!! The premise of this map, and the server, was just to mess around and kill yourself. Theres an entire course to take to get to the top of the map. You can race each other if you want, or go alone. If you dont want to take the course you can stay at the bottom and play with the different ways of killing yourself, or take the high dive from the top of the map, after a painfully slow elevator ride to the top.

After a hard drive crash I lost the RMF for this map, and couldnt work on it anymore. I had much more planned, but could never add it in, so this is the last version of this map there will be. However, I am (at the time I was writing this) making an OMG2, so im putting all of the things I wanted to add to the origional into that. For progress, or for a download if its out by the time you read this, see the website link near the top of the readme. You might have to scroll up to read it, if you have a shitty monitor.
