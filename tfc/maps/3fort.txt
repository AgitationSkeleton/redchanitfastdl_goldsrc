3 Fortresses - Capture the Flag

Red and Blue teams: 
Go into the enemy base and steel their flag.
Bring it back and put it on your team's logo,
up in the small sniper tower.

You get 10 points for capturing the enemy flag.

The flags will return to their bases after 60 
seconds.

Yellow team (Rebels):
Your objective is to kill as many people as
possible. You have two huge sniper towers and 
some secret entrances and exits at your 
disposal.
