Feared By Earth - Capture The Flag

Log 060-0S: The ground trembles as if it mimics
the pain of these worms. I wish there was a way 
of saving them, but the danger is too high to be
left unattended.

Objective: Make your way to the enemy base and
deactivate the security system to gain access 
to their flag chamber. Bring the flag back to 
your base for 10 points. The top route lasers 
and shoop lasers are also deactivated by the
security system.

Other Notes: Flag carriers drop the Flag when
they die. Dropped flags return to their Base
after 60 seconds. The security remains down 
for 45 seconds. Laser fields in the backway
and sewer entrance play an alarm noise when
tripped by enemies.
