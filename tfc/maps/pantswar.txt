Objective: Enter the enemy base and make
your way to where their pants reside in
their pants room. Grab them and take them
back to your capture point inside your own
pants room.

Scoring: 10 points per capture.

Other Notes: Pant carriers drop the pants
when they die. Dropped pants return to
their base after 60 seconds. A demoman can
destroy enemy's pants room wall with a
detpack.
