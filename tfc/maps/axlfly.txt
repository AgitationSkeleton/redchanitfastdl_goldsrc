HOW TO PLAY - (it's like murderball)
Grab Homer and hold onto him as long as you
can! 1 point is given to your team for every 5 seconds 
you have Him. If you have Homer you
can give your entire team Quad Damage by stepping on
the button on the top of either teams balcony.

(beta 9b 12/30/2004)
- Changed scoreboard textures from flags to Homer

  should keep players from hitting the lip

  base pillars to give more cover and added
  vents for safe landings from balconys

- That middle part on the launch ramps will
  now electrify people who block

Most maps take months to complete. I made this
over a weekend. Hate this map? Don't Care. 
I made it so I love it. Deal with it.
