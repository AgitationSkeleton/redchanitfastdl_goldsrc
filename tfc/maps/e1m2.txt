Converted From DMC BY Axl

To cap the flag your flag must be returned.
If your flag is dropped by the enemy, 
touch it to make it return.

I miss the good old days of controlled
chaos that Quake 1 had. So I converted
this over from Death Match Classic.

It'll probably be pure spam but what
the hell. 

Note: I'll probably continue to edit this
map once I play it a few times so this is not 
the final version.
