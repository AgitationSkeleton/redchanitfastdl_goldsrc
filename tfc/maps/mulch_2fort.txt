Construction

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Base New level from scratch 
Editor used Worldcraft v2.1 (the ultimate virus) 
Known Bugs None. If you think something is wrong, I probably intended it to be that way. 
Build Time All in all, probably about 2 months. I stopped for a while because I had switched to openGL, and parts of the level would just fade out. Then I found that I had reduced the maxdistance to 2000, so I upped it to 4096 and resumed working on the map.

Designer's Notes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
This is my first COMPLETE TFC level. Basically I was sick of the ordinary symmetrical maps, although I dig all the Valve ones... So I made this map. It probably won't be used in leagues though due to the fact that it's not symmetrical... so I'm making another map that is symmetrical and should be done soon. Actually, I have two maps I'm working on now.

Installation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
To play this level, extract the file "mulch_2fort.bsp" into your \half-life\tfc\maps directory and then start the game up, go to the console, and type in "map mulch_2fort". If you don't know how to do this, you really shouldn't be messing with custom made levels.
