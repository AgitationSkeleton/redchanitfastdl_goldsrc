"Murderball"
July 5, 2000

by: TheDreadedPyro 

Scoring:
---------------------------------------
Run to the center and grab the ball.  
Keep it as long as you can!  You can 
go into any of the bases with it, but 
everyone will know your location!  

You and your team will gain a point for 
every 5 seconds you hold the ball.

This map is designed to degenerate 
into complete chaos during larger 
games!
---------------------------------------

Bug fixes since version 2c:

1. no more dispenser-blocked door trick / 
   no more taking the ball in respawn rooms

2. added more player starts for a total of 24

Have fun with this map!

DESCRIPTION:  this is an updated version of mrdrball.bsp,
and fixes several problems that were present in that map.
---------------------------------------------------------
Players:  		4-20
Single Player:  	No
Deathmatch:  		No
Team Fortress Classic:  Yes
New Textures:  		Yes
New Sounds:  		No
New Models:  		No

INSTRUCTIONS:  place the .bsp and .txt files in the \tfc\maps 
subfolder of your Half-Life directory.  If you do not have a 
\maps subfolder in \tfc, create one.  

NOTE:  I used func_wall_toggle entities, i_t_g's, info_tfgoals, and 
multi_managers to make the blinking arrow signs that appear when 
the ball carrier is in a particular base.  

The i_t_g triggers the multi_manager, which in turn triggers the 
func_wall_toggle at 0 seconds and re-triggers it again at 0.7 seconds.  
The multi_manager also triggers an info_tfgoal entity at 1.4 seconds, 
and this is set to restore the i_t_g so that the ball carrier can 
keep re-activating it as long as he's in the trigger boundaries 
(the i_t_g brushes cover the insides of each base completely).

THANKS to:  Lobotomy Boy; Karl Gregory Jones; Casey, Dave, Joe,
Jake, Frank, & Josh; Matt Perkins, who let me use his great "Seeds" 
font for level creation (I used it on the base sign textures); the 
Info_Beta team;  and anyone I forgot.

EMAIL me at chris@atomic-pc.com with comments and / or map suggestions.
I don't have a lot of time for map making, but I'll try to answer your
email at least.  : )

COMMENTS:  Violent video games are just that- video games.  They should
not be taken too seriously!  Much of the enjoyment from these games
is in constructing the maps themselves...  and, of course,
talkin' trash during our highly competitive LAN playtests.  Hehe.
