Warning                 : You must have version 1.0.0.9 or better of Half-Life to
                          play this map.

Description		: Small map made mainly for LAN play but r_speeds were kept low enough
                          that it should be acceptable for SMALL (2-4 player) internet games.
                          

                          The object of this map is to get to the shotgun on the heliport in
                          the middle of the map and hold out as long as you can. The heliport
                          automatically awards one point every 6 seconds to anyone standing on
                          it. There are other weapons besides the shotgun, but they are usually
                          harder to get or not as useful in this sort of enviroment. Also, ammo
                          is very limited for other weapons. This was done to put emphasis on the
                          shotgun and the heliport. Lighting also dims the further out you
                          get from the middle area (heliport). This was done to allow creeping
                          and to make it harder for opponents standing on the heliport to 
                          instantly know where you are on spawn and be able to track you giving
                          you a chance to shoot or run at them out of the dark.

                          Also, players will start with 30 points of armor automatically.

                          When the map first starts, you will not be able to get to the heliport
                          as it will be surronded by a chain link fence. It will come down after
                          a period of time allowing everyone access to the pad. If however, you 
                          decide to jump over the fence and wait, you will be killed as soon
                          as the lightening sets off the explosives. Its better to use the time
                          before the fence comes down to gather as many other weapons, ammo, and
                          kills as possible. Also, if you are near the explosion when it goes
                          off, you will be hurt, and possibly killed depending on your current
                          state and position. The closer you are to it the more chance you
                          you will die.

                          There is also a mounted machine gun aimed toward the center heliport
                          that will help fend off powerful opponents who have a monopoly on
                          the heliport pad. This machine gun also gives the user (player)
                          points for kills.
