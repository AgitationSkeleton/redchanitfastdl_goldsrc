Comments                : 	
Killing Box is based on a Quake2 map called killingbox2.bsp that Drexoll gave to me (KinetiK) one day.  Not a great map by any stretch of the imagination but the carnage produced amazed the lot of us playing it.  We missed the fun factor in Half Life that killingbox2 provided for us in Quake2 and hence the re-creation of it here.  I have no idea how to operate the damn Worldcraft 2.0 so I got Ooblik to build one.  

Installation
------------

Unzip the file killbox.bsp and killbox.txt into your c:\sierra\halflife\valve\maps directory.


* Construction *

Base            :  Custom map from scratch.  Idea based on above mentioned Quake2 map.
Build Time      :  5-7 hours (plus playtesting etc etc)

Times & stats   : System Used      : Pentium II-300 SCSI,  128 MB
                  Qbsp             : 1 second
                  Vis (-level 4)   : 1 second
                  Light (-extra)   : 62 seconds

Texture WAD used:	halflife.wad
Editor(s) used  :	Worldcraft 2.0
Known Bugs      :
 
1)  _VERY_ processor intensive map.  LARGE LARGE volume of the map precludes any more than 4 or 5 players on the internet.  You really wouldn't want anymore than this to play at one time though.  

2)  Red lights shine on ceiling.  Not a bug an issue.
