----Background Info---------------------------------------------------
Having played the sin demo last year, i was really impressed with one of the multi-player maps 'spyrdemo' , I knew sin used the quake 2 engine, so after a little messing with winbspc, I managed to get a textureless version of the map into worldcraft -

As I had only completed one v.shit map before, I thought it would be a good way to improve my worldcraft skills, by coverting this map for half-life.
 
At one stage I added a big outdoor bit, with a huge bmx,doghouse and pile of 'steaming' dog poo, but the gameplay didn't flow so I took it out.

--Best bit-----------------------------------------------------------
*The glass on the table seems to dynamically reflect the light as you walk around it. It's really just 2 cylinders inside each other, one white and one glass
* I managed to use only standard half-life textures, so no messing around with extra wad files for you lucky people.

-----Worst bit---------------------------------------------------
*R-speeds are too high, not sure how they got around it in the original sin map though.

---Recommended Specs---------------------------------------------
Due to the high r_speeds i would suggest a min of Pentium 2 300 with a voodoo 2, cause thats what i've got and it works fine for me!!!

Deathmatch	:yes
Single Player	:no
Map Description	:Medium Size
How Many Players:3-8 players
